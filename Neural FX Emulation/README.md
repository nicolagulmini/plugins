Aim to predict wet from dry, black box modeling an existing fx chain.

Look at wav for samples:
clean = dry, effect = wet
- audio is a folder with some recs to try models
- harmonic: make a guitar sounds like every note is a natural harmonic
- dirty_rec: make a rec from a device sounds like an amp
- gtr_crusher: make a guitar sounds like my plugin
- loop.wav is another rec I use to try models
