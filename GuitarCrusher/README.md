# Guitar Crusher

Excited to unveil my very first plugin to the world! 🌟 I've dedicated my time to learning JUCE basics and crafting this Bitcrusher prototype, designed to add some spice to modern guitar clean tones (check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7FHFVxrLBM&ab_channel=NicolaGulmini)). I delved deep into both the algorithmic part (think bitcrushing, downsampling, and more) and the aesthetic realm, creating an interface that's not just clean and nice, but also irresistibly intuitive for everyone! ✨ The design echoes the style of my upcoming self-produced EP, where I harness the power of this plugin. Stay tuned for its release! 🎸❄️
